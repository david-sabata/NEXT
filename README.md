NEXT (Neat EXtensible Tasklist) is a school project, originally done by 5 people. 

It is a proof of concept that it's possible to build a shared tasklist above some existing layer, currently Google Drive (but Dropbox was also an option).

The application should be in a working state, but **it is not under development since Q4/2012**
